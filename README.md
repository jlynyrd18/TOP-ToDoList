# TOP-ToDoList
A project from The Odin Project to make a To Do List

1. Will need to use factories or constructors/classes to generate projects/task
2. each item should have title, description, duedate, and priority.
3. The todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos. When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of 'default' project to which all of their todos are put. Users should be able to crate new projects and choose which project their todos go into.
4. Sepereate application logic (ie. creating new todos, setting todos as completed, changing todo priority etc.) from DOM-related stuff.
5. UI is up to you but the user should be able to do the following: 1. View all projects. 2. View all todos in each project 3. Expand a single todo to see/edit its details 4. Delete a todo
6. Store data with localStorage
